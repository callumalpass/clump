  "ai_summary": "Migrate scheduled job commands from .claude/ to .clump/ directory for multi-CLI support",
  "notes": "Changed command storage paths to use .clump/ instead of .claude/ directories:\n\n1. User global commands: ~/.clump/commands/ (was ~/.claude/commands/)\n2. Repo-specific commands: {repo}/.clump/commands/ (was {repo}/.claude/commands/)\n3. Built-in commands remain in clump's .claude/commands/ as defaults\n\nThis change enables scheduled job prompts to work with multiple CLI agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex) instead of being tied to Claude Code's directory structure.",
  "suggested_fix": "Update get_user_commands_dir() and get_repo_commands_dir() in backend/app/routers/commands.py to return .clump paths",
